/*
 * Given an interval list which are flying and landing time of the flight. How many airplanes are on the sky at most?

 Notice

If landing and flying happens at the same time, we consider landing should happen at first.

Example
For interval list

[
  [1,10],
  [2,3],
  [5,8],
  [4,7]
]
Return 3
